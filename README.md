# Machine Learning Projects

This repository showcases various machine learning projects that I have worked on as part of my learning journey. The main algorithms implemented include linear regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and K-Means clustering.

## Projects

### 1. **Linear Regression**
   - Predicts student grades based on features like study time and absences.
   - **Script**: `Linear_regression.py`

### 2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
   - Classifies cars based on attributes like price and safety.
   - **Script**: `KNN_learning.py`

### 3. **K-Means Clustering**
   - Clusters digits from the digits dataset using PCA for dimensionality reduction.
   - **Script**: `K_Clustering.py`

### 4. **Multiple Linear Regression with Pickle**
   - Predicts student grades and demonstrates saving models using `pickle`.
   - **Script**: `Multiple_modules.py`

## How to Run:
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
